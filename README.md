Recipes website - TOP HTML Foundations Project

This project is all about creating a very simple website that houses recipes. The recipes, however, are not really the point of this project. This project is all about displaying a basic level of competence with some foundational HTML elements.

Elements used to create these pages include: paragraphs, headings, images, anchors, ordered and unordered lists.
